# Game Recommendation Engine: Analyzing a Video game Database

_Fancy name, huh?_
_Don't let it fool you, it's just a simple school project._

A project that I made for a teacher during a summer period. 
This project contains a series of data-driven analysis to determine which game is most suitable for my teacher to play next.

Note: This project was an extra credit assignment which I enjoyed doing. 
I decided to upload it to GitHub to show my work.


## Introduction

This is a project for an analytics-driven course called "Análisis de Biología Computacional."
My teacher, Drao. Ella Raquel Acuña Gonzáles gave us a file called `videojuegos.xlsx`.
This file contains a database of video games, with the following columns:
